# Distributed System Project

This project demonstrates a basic setup for a distributed system using microservices architecture with Python, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Project Structure

## Services

### Service A

A simple Flask application that responds with a message.

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/service-a`: Returns a message from Service A.

### Service B

A simple Flask application that responds with a message.

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/service-b`: Returns a message from Service B.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or any other Kubernetes cluster)

### Building Docker Images

Navigate to the root directory of each service and build the Docker images:

```sh
cd services/service-a
docker build -t service-a:latest .

cd ../service-b
docker build -t service-b:latest .

## Deploying to Kubernetes
### Apply the Kubernetes configurations:

kubectl apply -f k8s/service-a-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-a-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-b-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-b-service.yaml

Accessing the Services
Use kubectl get services to get the external IPs and ports for the services. Access the services using the provided IPs and ports.

Monitoring and Logging
Implement monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.

Security
Secure the services using TLS/SSL and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
